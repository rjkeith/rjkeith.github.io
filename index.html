<h1>Ryan J. Keith</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate, impactful educator with eight years' experience teaching biological science to university students and zoo guests. I'm also a qualified high school teacher with extensive formal training in best pedagogical practice, which I have adapted to suit adult learners. I explore the natural world alongside my students with curiosity and wonder, nurturing a love of nature and fervour for conservation. My PhD research focuses on the process by which knowledge, emotion, and experience combine to connect people with nature and evoke a conservation ethic. I hope to apply my findings ever more successfully.</p>
